import For from "05.for.zig?raw";

For loops are used to iterate over arrays (and other types, to be discussed
later). For loops follow this syntax. Like while, for loops can use `break` and
`continue`. Here, we've had to assign values to `_`, as Zig does not allow us to
have unused values.

<Code code={For} collapse="1-2" lang="zig"/>

Blocks of code may be forcibly executed at compile time using the
[`comptime`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#comptime) keyword. In
this example, the variables x and y are equivalent.

<Code code={ComptimeBlocks} collapse="1-2" lang="zig"/>

Integer literals are of the type `comptime_int`. These are special in that they
have no size (they cannot be used at runtime!), and they have arbitrary
precision. `comptime_int` values coerce to any integer type that can hold them.
They also coerce to floats. Character literals are of this type.

<Code code={ComptimeInts} collapse="1-2" lang="zig"/>

`comptime_float` is also available, which internally is an `f128`. These cannot
be coerced to integers, even if they hold an integer value.

Types in Zig are values of the type `type`. These are available at compile time.
We have previously encountered them by checking
[`@TypeOf`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#TypeOf) and comparing with
other types, but we can do more.

<Code code={ComptimeTypeBranching} collapse="1-2" lang="zig"/>

Function parameters in Zig can be tagged as being
[`comptime`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#comptime). This means
that the value passed to that function parameter must be known at compile time.
Let's make a function that returns a type. Notice how this function is
PascalCase, as it returns a type.

<Code code={ComptimeReturningType} collapse="1-2" lang="zig"/>

We can reflect upon types using the built-in
[`@typeInfo`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#typeInfo), which takes
in a `type` and returns a tagged union. This tagged union type can be found in
[`std.builtin.Type`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.builtin.Type)
(info on how to make use of imports and std later).

<Code code={ComptimeTypeinfo} collapse="1-2" lang="zig"/>

We can use the [`@Type`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Type)
function to create a type from a
[`@typeInfo`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#typeInfo).
[`@Type`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Type) is implemented for
most types but is notably unimplemented for enums, unions, functions, and
structs.

Here anonymous struct syntax is used with `.{}`, because the `T` in `T{}` can be
inferred. Anonymous structs will be covered in detail later. In this example we
will get a compile error if the `Int` tag isn't set.

<Code code={ComptimeType} collapse="1-2" lang="zig"/>

Returning a struct type is how you make generic data structures in Zig. The
usage of [`@This`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#This) is required
here, which gets the type of the innermost struct, union, or enum. Here
[`std.mem.eql`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std;mem.eql) is
also used which compares two slices.

<Code code={ComptimeReturnStruct} collapse="1-2" lang="zig"/>

The types of function parameters can also be inferred by using `anytype` in
place of a type. [`@TypeOf`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#TypeOf)
can then be used on the parameter.

<Code code={ComptimeAnytype} collapse="1-2" lang="zig"/>

Comptime also introduces the operators `++` and `**` for concatenating and
repeating arrays and slices. These operators do not work at runtime.

<Code code={ComptimeConcatRepeat} collapse="1-4" lang="zig"/>

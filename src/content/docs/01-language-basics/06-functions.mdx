**All function arguments are immutable** - if a copy is desired the user must
explicitly make one. Unlike variables, which are snake_case, functions are
camelCase. Here's an example of declaring and calling a simple function.

<Code code={Functions} collapse="1-2" lang="zig"/>

Recursion is allowed:

<Code code={FunctionsRecursion} collapse="1-2" lang="zig"/>

When recursion happens, the compiler is no longer able to work out the maximum
stack size, which may result in unsafe behaviour - a stack overflow. Details on
how to achieve safe recursion will be covered in future.

Values can be ignored using `_` instead of a variable or const declaration. This
does not work at the global scope (i.e. it only works inside functions and
blocks) and is useful for ignoring the values returned from functions if you do
not need them.

```zig
_ = 10;
```

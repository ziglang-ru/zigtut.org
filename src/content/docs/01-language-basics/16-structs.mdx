Structs are Zig's most common kind of composite data type, allowing you to
define types that can store a fixed set of named fields. Zig gives no guarantees
about the in-memory order of fields in a struct or its size. Like arrays,
structs are also neatly constructed with `T{}` syntax. Here is an example of
declaring and filling a struct.

<Code code={Struct} lang="zig"/>

Struct fields cannot be implicitly uninitialised:

```zig
test "missing struct field" {
    const my_vector = Vec3{
        .x = 0,
        .z = 50,
    };
    _ = my_vector;
}
```

```
error: missing field: 'y'
    const my_vector = Vec3{
                        ^
```

Fields may be given defaults:

<Code code={StructDefaults} lang="zig"/>

Like enums, structs may also contain functions and declarations.

Structs have the unique property that when given a pointer to a struct, one
level of dereferencing is done automatically when accessing fields. Notice how,
in this example, `self.x` and `self.y` are accessed in the swap function without
needing to dereference the self pointer.

<Code code={StructDeclarations} collapse="1-2" lang="zig"/>
